# Regression Analysis of Daily Demand Forecasting Orders Dataset

In this project, we perform a detailed regression analysis on the Daily Demand Forecasting Orders dataset. The dataset contains information about daily demand for orders, and our objective is to develop regression models that can accurately predict the daily demand based on the provided features.

To begin the analysis, we conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the structure and characteristics of the dataset. We examine the distribution of variables, identify outliers, and explore any patterns or relationships between the features. This step allows us to understand the dataset better and make informed decisions throughout the analysis.

Handling missing values is crucial to ensure the integrity of our regression models. We employ appropriate techniques to fill in the missing values, ensuring that the dataset is complete and ready for further analysis.

To visualize the patterns of missing values, we construct a Missing Values Ratio (MSNO) matrix. The MSNO matrix provides a visual representation of missing values, enabling us to identify any systematic patterns or dependencies between variables. This step helps us in understanding the impact of missing data on our analysis and making informed decisions on data preprocessing.

To prepare the dataset for regression modeling, we apply feature scaling. Feature scaling brings all the features within a specific range, preventing any potential biases introduced by variables with different scales.

Furthermore, we utilize one-hot encoding to transform categorical variables into a binary format suitable for regression analysis. This process ensures that we can effectively incorporate categorical features into our regression models.

To reduce the dimensionality of the dataset and potentially improve the performance of our models, we employ Principal Component Analysis (PCA). PCA identifies the most important features that capture the maximum variance in the data. By reducing the dimensionality, we aim to focus on the most influential features and eliminate redundant information.

For the regression analysis, we employ four commonly used techniques:
1. Linear Regression
2. Decision Tree Regression
3. Random Forest Regression
4. Support Vector Machine (SVM) Regression

To identify the best hyperparameters for each regression technique, we utilize GridSearchCV. GridSearchCV exhaustively searches through a specified parameter grid, allowing us to find the optimal combination of parameters for each regression model.

To evaluate the performance of our regression models, we calculate various metrics, including Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). These metrics provide insights into the accuracy and precision of our models' predictions.

Furthermore, we apply K-fold Cross Validation to validate our findings. K-fold Cross Validation divides the dataset into K subsets and performs multiple iterations of training and testing on different subsets. By averaging the results across these iterations, we obtain a more robust evaluation of our regression models' performance and generalizability.

In summary, this project aims to develop regression models to forecast the daily demand for orders based on the Daily Demand Forecasting Orders dataset. Through EDA, missing value handling, feature scaling, one-hot encoding, PCA dimensionality reduction, and the application of four regression techniques, we strive to build accurate and reliable models for demand forecasting. The evaluation metrics and cross-validation provide a comprehensive assessment of our models' performance and validity.
